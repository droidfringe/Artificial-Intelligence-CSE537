Description:<br />
  -> Implemented BFS, DFS, Uniform cost search and A* search methods for finding goal state.<br />
  -> Implemented the Corner search problem. Defined state space, successor function and goal test.<br />
 Â -> Came up with admissable and consistent heuristics for solving corner search and food search problems using A*<br />

Assignment 2: Multi-agent PacMan<br />

Description:<br />
  -> Came up with evaluation function for states to help reflex agent to choose the best action.<br />
  -> Implemented MiniMax, MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning and Expectimax for choosing best action.<br />

Assignment 3: Golomb Ruler<br />

Description:<br />
  -> Modeled finding markings on Golomb ruler as constraint satisfaction problem.<br />
  -> Solved the CSP using backtracking, Forward Checking and Constraint Propagation.<br />

Assignment 4: Tracking Ghosts<br />
Link - http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse537/project04.html<br />
Description:<br />
  -> Updated pacman's belief about ghosts using measurements and movement model.<br />
  -> Used both sources of information to track ghosts.<br />

Assignment 5: Decision Tree:<br />

Description:<br />
  -> Trained decision trees to classify whether a user will visit another page on the website or not.<br />
